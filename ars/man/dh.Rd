\title{Derivative of logarithm of functions}
\usage{
dh(xi, g)
}
\arguments{
\item{xi}{sorted points in T, which contains k abscissae in the domain D}

\item{g}{the density function used to perform the rejection sampling, where g(x) = cf(x). f(x) is the density that we actually want to sample points from}
}
\description{
This function calculate the derivative of h(x), where h(x) is the log of functions
}
\examples{
dh(xi,g,leftb,rightb)
dh(c(1,2,3),dnorm,-4,4)
}
